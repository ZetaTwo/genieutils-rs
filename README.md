# Parsing Library for AoE2 Data Files

This library is a Rust port of [genieutils-py](https://github.com/siegeEngineers/genieutils-py/).

This library can be used to read and write empires2_x2_p1.dat files for Age of Empires II Definitive Edition.

## Status

The library is fully functional, including both the Rust library and the Python bindings.
Unfortunately, the documentation is essentially non-existent and neither the Rust library nor the Python package have been published yet.

## Supported dat versions

Currently, only the recent versions used in Age of Empires II Definitive Edition are supported (GV_C20 and above, corresponding to FileVersion 7.7 and above).
