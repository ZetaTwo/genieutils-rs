# Parsing Library for AoE2 Data Files

This library is a Rust port of [genieutils-py](https://github.com/siegeEngineers/genieutils-py/).

This library can be used to read and write empires2_x2_p1.dat files for Age of Empires II Definitive Edition.

## Status

The parser and serialzier itself is fully functional. The Python bindings are still work in progress.
There's also very little documentation.

## Supported dat versions

Currently, only the recent versions used in Age of Empires II Definitive Edition are supported (GV_C20 and above, corresponding to FileVersion 7.7 and above).
